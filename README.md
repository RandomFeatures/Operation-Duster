# Operation-Duster
This is the second game I ever wrote. I made it on request from a guy who wanted a game using his artwork. He apparently played my first game Fluffy(also on github) and email me asking if I would build a game about his car using his artwork. Why not?
The game is so simple and stupid that I almost did not include it, but what the hell
If you are brave enough and want to give it a try I included the exe in the zip file. 
The file dates say Feb 1999, but I know for sure I was still living in Ohio when I made this so sometime in 1998 is more likely.
